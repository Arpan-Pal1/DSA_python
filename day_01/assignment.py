Remove all the non-int value from the list

ðŸ’¡ tips: For historic reasons, Python treats bool as a subclass of int. This means that True is an instance of int.
    Originally, Python didnâ€™t have a separate bool type. Instead, truth values were represented as 1 (for True) and 0 (for False).
    When bool was introduced, it needed to be compatible with existing code. So, True and False were designed to behave like 1 and 0, respectively, for backward compatibility.
    As a result, True inherits f tips: 


li = ['Arpan', 1, True, 0+5j, 15]
filtered_list = [x for x in li if isinstance(x, int) and not isinstance(x, bool)]
print(filtered_list)

print(li)
